  As an Event organiser
  I would like to add an event record to data hub
  So that I can enable the collection of key events data

  Background:
    Given I am an authenticated user on the data hub website

  @events__save-new-event--submit
  Scenario: Verify event is submitted

    When I navigate to the create an event page
    And I enter all mandatory fields related to the event
    And I click the save button
    Then I see the success message

    And I verify the event address line 1 has an error message
    And I verify the event address town has an error message
    And I verify the event address country has an error message
    Then I see the error message
