/**
 * This module is a registry of all Redux action types used within the app.
 * Redux actions are shared by all components/reducers so their names must not
 * collide. Having them defined as constants in a single module is a simple
 * measure to prevent such hard to debug cases.
 *
 * The name and value of the constants must be the same.
 * The name should be the name of the component the action relates to and a verb
 * describing what it does, concattenated by double underscore.
