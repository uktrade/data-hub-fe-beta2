An express application that fetches data from a back end JSON based api and renders it to the screen.
This front end layer is primarily turning requests from the browser into back end API calls and then
rendering them using Nunjucks template language.

The client layer applies the ideals of progressive enhancement so that a wide range of devices can
access it, no matter what their limitation.

In order to use the application the front end layer must be run, with a small number of settings,
and be provided with a back end server to provide the API, data storage and search engine capabilities.

## Getting started

### Docker

The project comes with docker compose files, this means if you have docker
you can start the app with a single command.

There are 2 docker files.

#### docker-compose.yml

This will run the front end server locally, but will point to a remote backend.

##### Environment Variables

These environment variables are sourced from `.env` (Docker Compose [supports declaring default environment variables](https://docs.docker.com/compose/environment-variables/#the-envfile-configuration-option)
in an environment file).

#### Setting up with docker-compose

1.  Create a `.env` file:

    ```shell
    cp sample.env .env
    ```

2.  Ensure that the `.env` file is pointing to a valid [data-hub-leeloo backend](https://github.com/uktrade/data-hub-leeloo/)
    using the `API_ROOT` environment variable.

    - You may want to run a local copy of the leeloo backend.  By default,
      you can run both leeloo and the frontend under one docker-compose project.
      [See the instructions in the leeloo readme to set it up](https://github.com/uktrade/data-hub-leeloo/#installation-with-docker).


3.  To start the server just:

    ```shell
    docker-compose up
    ```

    The server starts in developer mode, which means that when you make local
    changes it will auto-compile sass or javavscript, and will restart nodejs
    when server side changes are made. A container with redis will also start,
    this is linked to the data hub container.

    You can access the server on port 3000,
    [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). You can also run a remote
    debug session over port 9229 if using webstorm/Intellij or Visual Studio Code

4.  You will need to set up OAuth.  It is recommended to use the
    [uktrade/mock-sso](https://github.com/uktrade/mock-sso) backend as this is
    fully compatible with docker-compose projects -
    [see the OAuth section for more detail](#oauth).

### Native install

#### Dependencies

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (>= 8.0.0)
* [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) (>= 0.23.4)
* [Redis](https://redis.io/)

The project is using ES6 async/await therefore Node 8 is required.

### Installation

1. Clone repository and change directory:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/UKTradeInvestment/data-hub-frontend && cd data-hub-frontend
   ```

2. Install node dependencies:

   ```
   yarn install
   ```

3. Create a copy of the sample .env file and add values for the keys
   (a current member of the project team can give you these):

   ```
   cp sample.env .env
   ```

4. Run an instance of Redis and change `REDIS_HOST` and `REDIS_PORT` in your
   .env file if necessary

#### Run in production mode

Builds static assets and runs a server using node

```
yarn run build && yarn start
```

#### Run in development mode

Server watches for changes and rebuilds sass or compiles js using webpack as
needed. Changes to server side code will result in the server autorestarting.
The server will run with the node debug flag so you can debug with Webstorm
or Visual Studio Code.

```
yarn run develop
```

### Updating NodeJs
When NodeJs is updated it is worth noting it needs to be updated in a few places:

#### Cloud foundry build pack
Please update the build pack in `manifest.yml` to use the required [cloud foundry build pack release](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/nodejs-buildpack/releases).
Once this is done you can then choses the node version for the next steps.

#### Engines package.json
Engines in `package.json` needs updating:
```
  "engines": {
    "node": "<node_version>"
  },
```

#### Version inside .nvmrc
Default node version for `nvm` is defined inside .nvmrc. Update by running:
```
  echo "v8.15.1"  > .nvmrc
```

#### CircleCi config
The value used in `.circleci/config.yaml` needs updating:
```
  - &node_version   <node_version>
```

#### Data hub base docker
The version of the NodeJs docker that is used in our CircleCi Acceptance tests jobs needs to be updated in
[uktrade/docker-data-hub-base](https://github.com/uktrade/docker-data-hub-base). You will also need to wait for the
[docker automated build](https://hub.docker.com/r/ukti/docker-data-hub-base/builds/) to finish.

### OAuth
Data hub uses [uktrade/staff-sso](https://github.com/uktrade/staff-sso) for OAuth. Details of the required environment
variables needed to setup OAuth can be seen in the [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) section.
For further information about how to setup OAuth:
- Look in confluence for details on setting up SSO for developers. Instructions can be found in
  `Data Hub team > Technical Documentation > Frontend > SSO for developers`.

#### Bypassing OAuth in development mode
If you wish to completely bypass SSO functionality locally you can by setting the environment variable:
```
export OAUTH2_BYPASS_SSO=true
```
and providing a valid `OAUTH2_DEV_TOKEN` environment variable. This Access token needs to be valid for the SSO provider
the application is pointed at.

#### Using SSO when developing
Developers can also test SSO functionality locally by removing the `OAUTH2_DEV_TOKEN` environment variable and making
sure that `OAUTH2_BYPASS_SSO` is set to false (it is by default). To use Oauth locally you will then need to set up the
correct access and SSO details for the SSO provider you are using.

##### SSO development providers

###### SSO mock
You could use the [uktrade/mock-sso](https://github.com/uktrade/mock-sso) repo.

If you are using docker-compose and the supplied `sample.env` file, the default
environment variables will suffice.  Run through the instructions to [set up
mock-sso under docker-compose here](https://github.com/uktrade/mock-sso#docker-compose).

If you are running natively, you will need to set up the following environment variables:
```
export OAUTH2_DEV_TOKEN=exampleDevToken
export OAUTH2_TOKEN_FETCH_URL=http://localhost:8080/o/token
export OAUTH2_AUTH_URL=http://localhost:8080/o/authorize
```
data-hub-frontend will then use mock-sso to simply pass your `OAUTH2_DEV_TOKEN` between SSO and the application.

###### UAT SSO
You could point data-hub-frontend to the UAT SSO environment. If you wish to please speak to the
[#technology-sso](https://ditdigitalteam.slack.com/messages/C5FLP2DSM/details/) team to set up the correct access and
SSO details required.

### HTTP Basic Auth
When running with `OAUTH2_BYPASS_SSO` the frontend can be user/password protected by setting `BASIC_AUTH_USER` and `BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD`

###### Local checkout of staff SSO
You could checkout [uktrade/staff-sso](https://github.com/uktrade/staff-sso) locally and point data-hub-frontend
at that.

### Other Scripts

The [package.json](./package.json) file includes a number of useful scripts
for other tasks.

Run BDD tests using Mocha:

```
yarn run test
```

Lint both SASS and JS to make sure it conforms to rules:

```
yarn run lint
```

## Making changes

See the [contributing guide](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Components

This app includes support for including components using a custom [nunjucks
tag](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/api.html#custom-tags). This method
allows components to be available in all layouts, views, includes and macros
and allows each component to be a separating entity which makes maintaining
and testing them easier.

To include a component with its default state or one that expects no data:

```njk
{% component 'person' %}
```

To include a component and pass data to it:

```njk
{% component 'person', {
  name: 'Barry',
  age: '55'
} %}
```

Component can take multiple arguments. It will combine them in single object:

```js
res.render('some-page', {
  personData: {
    name: 'Barry',
    age: 55
  }
})
```
```njk
{% component 'person', personData, gender='male' %}
```

Is the same as:

```njk
{% component 'person', {
  name: 'Barry',
  age: '55',
  gender: 'male'
} %}
```

## Templates

Templates use Nunjuck's [template inheritance](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/templating.html#template-inheritance).
There are several top level blocks which are used for injecting content during rendering. Each subsequent template
that extends the base layout can include these additional blocks.

### Nunjucks base template blocks

Template block names are structured by combining main element names to form path. e.g. `head` wraps everything inside
the `head` element, the same applies to `headIcons`.

- `_layouts/template.njk extends govuk-frontend/template.njk` - the GOV.UK frontend template Data Hub extends from

```<head>```

  - `pageTitle` - contains the page title
  - `headIcons` - contains various GOV.UK icons
  - `head` - overridden by Data Hub containing mainly `<meta>`, `<link>` and `<script>` tags

```</head>```

```</body>```

  - `bodyStart` - contains Google Tag Manager (GTM) and the notification banner
  - `skipLink` - a GOV.UK "skip to content" link
  - `header` - overridden by Data Hub
     - `header_site_title` - wraps the site title
     - `header_menu` - wraps the header menu
     - `local_header` - wraps header content specific to the app
  - `main` - Data Hub overrides the GOV.UK main block
     - `content` - overridden by Data Hub
        - `local_nav` - wraps navigation specific to the app
        - `body_main_content` - contains main content (inside main#content)
  - `footer` - contains a GOV.UK footer which DataHub overrides with an empty block
  - `bodyEnd` - initialise scripts (e.g. app.js and GOV.UK frontend)

```</body>```

### Base template variables

Base layout checks for certain variables.

- `siteTitle` {string} - name of the site. Defaults to 'Department for International Trade'.
- `serviceTitle` {string} - name of the service.
- `phaseBanner` {boolean} - whether to show the separate phase banner or default to phase tag in the global header. Possible values: `true` and `false`.
- `projectPhase` {string} - phase of the project. Possible values: `alpha` and `beta`.

## Testing

### Functional Testing

The aim of this test suite is perform functional tests of frontend components in isolation.

#### Setup

Pre-requisites:

Ensure you have [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) v8 installed then install dependencies:

`$ npm install`

#### Coding standards

StandardJS will run as part of the build, assure you run the command below before committing:

`$ npm run lint`

#### Running the tests

Notice that before running the tests the application should be up and running.

By default cypress will run on electron headlessly, you can read more about it [here](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/core-concepts/launching-browsers.html#Electron-Browser)

Execute all the tests on `specs` in chrome browser:

`$ npm run test:functional -- --browser chrome`

#### Running the tests manually in cypress interface

`$ npm run test:functional:watch`

#### Running a specific spec

`$ npm run test:functional -- --spec test/functional/cypress/specs/nav-spec.js`

### Acceptance Testing
Data hub uses [Nightwatch.js](http://nightwatchjs.org), [nightwatch-cucumber](https://github.com/mucsi96/nightwatch-cucumber) and [cucumber.js](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-js) to run acceptance tests.

#### Running acceptance tests
For information on [cucumber-js](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-js) tags please see the `nightwatch-cucumber` docs [executing-individual-feature-files-or-scenarios](http://mucsi96.github.io/nightwatch-cucumber/#executing-individual-feature-files-or-scenarios)

#### Running tests with specific user permissions
To run tests against a specific user permissions type:
- Change your `OAUTH2_DEV_TOKEN` environment variable to use one of:
  - `lepStaffToken`
  - `daStaffToken`
  - `ditStaffToken`
  - `policyFeedbackStaffToken`
- Use the relevant `yarn` script `yarn circle:acceptance:<staff type>` (see [package.json](/package.json))

##### Dev api tokens
The above permissions tokens are available on the dev api

##### Backend locally with user permission tokens
If you are running the api locally please run the [https://github.com/uktrade/data-hub-leeloo/blob/develop/setup-uat.sh](https://github.com/uktrade/data-hub-leeloo/blob/develop/setup-uat.sh) to setup the relevant users and permission tokens

##### Adding tokens
If you need to add a token have a look in confluence on how to do this `Data Hub team > Technical Documentation > Frontend > SSO for developers > Adding an Access token`.

You run acceptance tests via:
```
yarn test:acceptance
```

You can run a group (folder) of tests via:
```
yarn test:acceptance -- --group <folder-name>
```
e.g:
```
yarn test:acceptance -- --group audit
```

You can run a specific feature via:
```
yarn test:acceptance -- --tag <feature-tag>
```
e.g:
```
yarn test:acceptance -- --tag audit-company--name
```

You can also run the tests pointing to browserstack.
Ensure you have the user and access key in your environment variables.
You can find the browserstack credentials which lead to the info below on Rattic.
e.g:
```
BROWSERSTACK_USERNAME=username
BROWSERSTACK_ACCESS_KEY=accesskey
```

Then run:
```
REMOTE_RUN=true yarn test:acceptance:remote --env ie11,firefox --tag audit-company--name
```

#### Naming conventions
##### Folders
We use singular or plural folder names. E.g `contacts`, `companies`, `audit`.

##### Filenames

We use singular names
- `page-object` names with PascalCase case. E.g `Login`, `Contact`, `ContactList`.
- `step_definitions` names with Kebabcase case. E.g `login`, `contact`, `company`.
- `feature` names with Kebabcase case. E.g `create`, `login`, `list`.

##### Feature tags
We name features after the folder name and file name. So `/auth/login.feature` would have the feature tag `@auth-login`


##### Scenario tags
We name scenarios after the feature name with a double hyphen separating the scenarios tag. So a scenario in the `@auth-login` feature would be `@auth-login--logout`

##### Permissions tags
To run a scenario against a specific type of user you can use the following tags:
- `@da` will run the test against a user with `da` permissions
- `@lep` will run the test against a user with `lep` permissions

#### Ignoring features
You can tell `nightwatch.js` not to run a feature by adding the tag `@ignore`.


## Continuous Integration
Data hub uses [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/) for continuous integration.

### Running CI jobs
- All branches run the `lint_code`, `unit_tests` and `user_acceptance_tests` CI jobs
- You can skip the `user_acceptance_tests` CI job by using a branch starting with `/^skip-tests.*/`
- The `user_acceptance_tests_master` job will run on branches that match the regex `release.*` or the `master` branch. This job runs a branch against the `master` branch of [data-hub-leeloo](https://github.com/uktrade/data-hub-leeloo/tree/master)

### Setting up users with different permissions
On CircleCi we run Acceptance tests against users with different permissions. We do this via the environment variable `OAUTH2_DEV_TOKEN`. Essentially we have users with different permissions setup in a job via `OAUTH2_DEV_TOKEN` and then we run tests with the specified permissions tag.
So for setting up a test for a user of type `LEP` you need to:
- add a token to the backend with a token associated to the permissions type. e.g `lepStaffToken`
- add this token to the environment variable `OAUTH2_DEV_TOKEN` in the circleCi job
- write a permission test and specify a tag in the cucumber feature. e.g `@lep`
- specify which tag to use when running `nightwatch`. e.g `npm run circle:acceptance --  --tag lep`

### Base docker image
The acceptance tests `user_acceptance_tests` job uses the docker image `ukti/docker-data-hub-base` as a base for running a selenium server and data hub frontend
Details can be found in the [GitHub](https://github.com/uktrade/docker-data-hub-base) and [docker](https://hub.docker.com/r/ukti/docker-data-hub-base/) repositories.

### Data hub backend docker image
The acceptance tests `user_acceptance_tests` job on circleCi uses its own version of [uktrade/data-hub-leeloo](https://github.com/uktrade/data-hub-leeloo).
The `uktrade/data-hub-leeloo` docker image and tags that is used is automatically built via a Docker hub automated job. Details can be found [https://hub.docker.com/r/ukti/data-hub-leeloo](https://hub.docker.com/r/ukti/data-hub-leeloo).

- `user_acceptance_tests` job uses `ukti/data-hub-leeloo:latest`
- `user_acceptance_tests_master` job uses `ukti/data-hub-leeloo:master`

### Mock SSO docker build
The acceptance tests `user_acceptance_tests` job on circleCi uses [uktrade/mock-sso](https://github.com/uktrade/mock-sso)
to run the application through the SSO workflow. The `uktrade/mock-sso` docker image and tag that is used is
automatically built via a Docker hub automated job. Details can be found [https://hub.docker.com/r/ukti/mock-sso](https://hub.docker.com/r/ukti/mock-ssoo).

- `user_acceptance_tests` job uses `uktrade/mock-sso:latest`
- `user_acceptance_tests_master` job uses `uktrade/mock-sso:latest`

### Job failure
CircleCI has been configured to show you a summary report of what has failed on the following workflows:
- `unit_tests`
- `lint_code`
- `user_acceptance_tests`

When acceptance tests fail you can also have a look at the `Nightwatch.js` html report found in the jobs artifacts folder.
This can be accessed by logging in to [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/)

## Deployment

Commits to `develop` are automatically deployed to a heroku instance. Pull
requests deploy to a [review app](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/github-integration-review-apps)
from this heroku instance.

Deployments to staging and production are done manually through Jenkins and are
deployed from the `master` branch.
